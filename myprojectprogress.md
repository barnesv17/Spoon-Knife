 I am on the executive council of a sorority on campus.
 Since being a part of the council, I've noticed that all of our information and resrouces are very unorganized.
 I would love to make one place where we can easily access upcoming events, finances, etc.
 
 This would be more of a WebDev project. I have very little experience working with WebDev, so it will also be a great learning opportunity.
 It will probably be a common repository like the one used later in part 3 of this lab.
